First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Prof. Dr. Andreas Frommer. From the very first email inquiring about the possibility of working under his supervision to every step throughout the course of this thesis, he has been consistently kind, generous, and supportive. I deeply appreciate his guidance in helping me grasp the critical concepts required for my research and his invaluable assistance in rectifying the mistakes I made along the way. Our weekly meetings were always constructive, enlightening, and filled with engaging discussions, which I truly cherished. It has been a remarkable experience to complete my thesis under his supervision, and I am sincerely grateful for the initial ideas and references he provided that shaped the foundation of this work.

I am also deeply grateful to Dr. Gustavo Alonso Ramirez Hidalgo for his exceptional support and guidance. At the early stages of my thesis, I found certain technical concepts challenging to understand, but his clear explanations helped me navigate through these difficulties. I greatly appreciate the time and effort he invested in reviewing my algorithms and code, ensuring better implementations. Despite leaving the University of Wuppertal, he continued to offer his support, for which I will always be indebted.
